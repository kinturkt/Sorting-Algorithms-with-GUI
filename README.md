Here, I have made a project on well-known Sorting algorithms. I made a menu using Python programming language where user can select their choice of algorithm, 
<br>
enter their desired input size and obtain the sorted output.
<br>
Additionally, I have made a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using the Tkinter module of Python.
<br>
It is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolki. Tkinter is included with standard Linux, Microsoft Windows and macOS installs of Python. 
<br>
The name Tkinter comes from Tk interface.
<br>
There are different ways to create GUI such as using <pyscript> element in HTML, using Python modules like pyautogui and PySimpleGUI, PyQt, and many more.
